	#MODULES
	Modules should not be touched unless you have a set of mixins or placeholder
	selectors that should become standard.
	Place all your custom mixins and selectors in /mixins

	Importing a module should result in no CSS ouput. These are just mixins
	or placeholder selectors that can be used throughout a project.

	#THIRD PARTY VENDORS
	Add your vendor css files here. When adding vendor files to the folder, 
	remember to add .scss to the file so it compiles nicely.
	
	The list below represents the default vendor files that are included.
	Uncomment to include.

	#PROJECT SPECIFIC MIXINS
	Add your project specific mixins here.
	If you think the mixin you build should become a standard, please bring it
	up and we can discuss adding it to modules.

	#GLOBAL
	Global files are styles that dictate areas of a site that are repetitive.
	ex: Navigation, footer, and hero image styles are examples of global styles.

	#PARTIALS
	Partials encompass all the other block styles you'll have for your site.
	Each block should have it's own file. If you get enough block elements for
	a specific part of a site (ex: lots of home page specific partials), please
	regroup these partials in a subfolder in partials.
